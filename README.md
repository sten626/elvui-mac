elvui-mac
=========

A small bash script for installing and updating ElvUI on Mac.

Important
---------

If you are running this script for the first time and you already have ElvUI installed, you should delete the existing ElvUI folders first. Otherwise unexpected things might happen.

Usage
-----

Simply download `elvui-mac.sh` or do a `git clone` of the whole repo. You can then run it on the command line by navigating to its containing directory and running `./elvui-mac.sh`. This script requires that you have git installed, and also assumes that World of Warcraft is installed in the default location (`/Applications/World of Warcraft/`). You can also make the script run as an executable by making a copy of the `elvui-mac.sh` without `.sh` on the end, and then running `chmod +x ./elvui-mac` while in the containing directory.
