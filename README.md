elvui-mac
=========

A small bash script for installing and updating ElvUI on Mac.

Important
---------

If you are running this script for the first time and you already have ElvUI installed, you should delete the existing ElvUI folders first. Otherwise unexpected things might occur.

Usage
-----

Simply download `elvui-mac.sh` or do a `git clone` of the whole repo. You can then it on the command line by navigating to its containing directory and running `./elvui-mac.sh`. It requires that you have git installed, and also assumes that World of Warcraft is installed in the default location. You can also set it up to run the script as an executable by first running `chmod +x ./elvui-mac.sh` while in the containing directory.
